### Windows

  * [ZIP Package](http://static.totaltrash.org/d2k/d2k.zip)

### Source

Users are encouraged to build their own binaries. The source can be checked out
using Git and the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/camgunz/d2k

### Dependencies

_(This section is for those cross-compiling for Windows only)_

D2K has several dependencies, and rather than add them all to the codebase or
expect users to find/cross-compile them on their own, I've [started a
project](https://github.com/camgunz/mingw64-builds) that will build D2K's
dependencies using Mingw-w64.
