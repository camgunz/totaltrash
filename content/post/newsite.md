Ever since TotalTrash was converted to a static site, I've wanted a way to add
pages without copying and pasting tons of markup and updating the navbar.  I've
finally built a new site using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a static site
generator written in [Go](http://golang.org).

Additionally, I plan to feature more news on TT.  I've wanted a place to post
[D2K](/d2k) updates, and I think TT is where that belongs.

I may backdate some posts just for content's sake.  We'll see how it goes.
