### The Future of Doom

TotalTrash (TT) was a ZDaemon server set which hosted
[ZDDL](http://cdevastation.com/zddl), [IDL](http://intldoomleague.com), Private
CTF and various public CTF, Duel and Cooperative servers.  TT had the highest
uptime and highest overall connection quality of any of its contemporaries.

In 2010, TotalTrash ceased public operations due to conflicts with ZDaemon's
administration, but it continued to host IDL, ZDDL and Private CTF.  However,
after a time, TT scaled down its competitive offerings as well.  ZDDL held its
last season in 2011, and IDL switched to Odamex in the winter of 2012.  At that
point, TT's role as a host for ZDaemon fully came to an end.

Now, TotalTrash serves as a host for source port development, and it continues
to [host Doom WADs](http://static.totaltrash.org/wads).
