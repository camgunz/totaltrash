## Eternity Engine - Client/Server Edition

### Overview

Welcome to Eternity Engine - Client/Server Edition (EECS) testing.  Based on
the [Eternity Engine](http://www.doomworld.com/eternity), EECS is an advanced
client/server Doom port intended to provide high-quality, competitive gameplay.

### Getting Started

[Download an EECS client for your platform](eternity/download), place an IWAD
in the installation folder (usually something like
`C:\Program Files\Eternity Engine\bin`) and then visit [the
master](http://master.totaltrash.org) to see a list of servers. Clicking on one
of the links on the left will connect to that server, clicking anywhere else on
the row will show more information about that server in the sidebar.

If you get into any trouble at all, please see the [FAQ](eternity/faq).  While
we're happy to help, you're likely to get a fix for your issue much more
quickly by visiting the FAQ than by waiting for us.

### Reporting Bugs

The entire point of this testing is to discover and resolve issues in EECS,
however it's also a good time to ask for features or report deficiencies.
Reporting bugs is simple; there is a
[bug tracker](http://github.com/camgunz/eternity/issues), all you need to do is
create an account. Here are some guidelines for effective bug/feature posting:


  * Give as much information as you possibly can.
  * Use descriptive titles.
  * Be precise and specific.
  * Set label appropriately:
    * Bug: Incorrect behavior
    * Enhancement: New feature
  * Use an email address that you check.
  * If you can run a debugger, please post stack traces.

If more than a couple days goes by and no one's touched your bug or talked to
you about it, please contact us in [IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/d2k).  The bug
tracker is not where bugs and ideas go to die, it's a list of things for the TT
team to fix so we don't forget them.
