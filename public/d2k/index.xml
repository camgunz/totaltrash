&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K is an advanced Doom source port that aims to modernize the game while
remaining faithful to the original implementation. It is based on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;PrBoom+&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download a D2K version for your platform, place an IWAD in the installation
folder, and then run &lt;code&gt;doom2k.exe -net &amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Connection is currently
a manual process, but eventually D2K will include a server browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also start a server similarly, simply use all the command-line flags
you normally would, but add &lt;code&gt;-deltaserve&lt;/code&gt; to the arguments.  If you need to
listen on a specific address, you can use
&lt;code&gt;doom2k.exe ... -deltaserve &amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get into any trouble at all, please see the &lt;a href=&#34;d2k/faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.  While
we&amp;rsquo;re happy to help, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to get a fix for your issue much more
quickly by using the information there than by waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Reporting Bugs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue tracker is where we keep track of problems in D2K, but it is also
useful for feature requests.  Reporting bugs is simple; there is a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/camgunz/d2k/issues&#34;&gt;bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, all you need to do is
create an account. Here are some guidelines for effective bug/feature posting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give as much information as you possibly can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use descriptive titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be precise and specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set label appropriately:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug: Incorrect behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancement: New feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an email address that you check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can run a debugger, please post stack traces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more than a couple days goes by and no one&amp;rsquo;s touched your bug or talked to
you about it, please contact us in &lt;a href=&#34;irc://chat.freenode.net/d2k&#34;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;.  The bug
tracker is not where bugs and ideas go to die, it&amp;rsquo;s a list of things for the TT
team to fix so we don&amp;rsquo;t forget them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building D2K</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/d2k/building/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/d2k/building/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Source Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K&amp;rsquo;s source code is located &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/camgunz/d2k&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; you can
clone it with Git like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/camgunz/d2k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, there is a &lt;code&gt;build.sh&lt;/code&gt; script which will build D2K; the resulting
executable is built in the &lt;code&gt;cbuild&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K has quite a few dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libiconv (part of glibc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libpng&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libffi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gettext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pcre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fontconfig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeType&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HarfBuzz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cairo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pango&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libXDiff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ENet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDL_mixer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenGL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LZMA*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libjpeg*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libtiff*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebP*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDL_image*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DUMB*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PortMidi*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FluidSynth*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MikMod*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libmad*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libvorbis*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libogg*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libFLAC*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gperf*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* = optional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to add more, at least Jansson, libcurl, and PolarSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Arch Linux, the only dependency not bundled is libXDiff, which can be found
in the AUR. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I can&amp;rsquo;t help with other distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Cross-Compiling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/camgunz/mingw64-builds&#34;&gt;mingw64-builds&lt;/a&gt; is a project that
cross-compiles dozens of popular libraries using the Mingw-w64 cross-compiler.
You can clone it with Git like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/camgunz/mingw64-builds
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, mingw64-builds builds all the libraries in the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; subfolder.
When cross-compiling D2K, D2K expects the dependencies to be in its &lt;code&gt;crossdeps&lt;/code&gt;
folder. You can change both of these options if you need to. D2K contains a
&lt;code&gt;crossbuild.sh&lt;/code&gt; script which will cross-compile it for Windows. The resulting
executable is built in the &lt;code&gt;crossbuild&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Building on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no support for building on Windows.  I&amp;rsquo;ll accept patches for
IDEs or compilers that support C99, but I will not accept patches that modify
the code in order for it to work with a non-compliant system (MSVC++, for
example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for IDEs like Code::Blocks or CDT is planned, but not currently a
priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;MP3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MP3 support is on sketchy legal ground due to patents covering MP3 technology.
Use at your own risk. We strongly encourage mappers and modders to use the free
and superior OGG format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are encouraged to build their own binaries. The source can be checked out
using Git and the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/camgunz/d2k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This section is for those cross-compiling for Windows only)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K has several dependencies, and rather than add them all to the codebase or
expect users to find/cross-compile them on their own, I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/camgunz/mingw64-builds&#34;&gt;started a
project&lt;/a&gt; that will build D2K&amp;rsquo;s
dependencies using Mingw-w64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2012, I decided to leave the Doom community behind, but &lt;a href=&#34;../faq/#zdoom&#34;&gt;I became
saddened by the prospect that (G)ZDoom and Zandronum are becoming the de facto
Doom experience&lt;/a&gt; and instead of whining about it, decided to
step up and build a Doom source port I think is worthy of being the standard.
What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;State Of The Art Netcode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The netcode model used by the major client/server ports (Odamex, Zandronum and
ZDaemon) is fundamentally flawed. D2K will implement netcode based on delta
compression, very similar to the system used by Quake 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, D2K will also employ techniques to improve the experience for
players on lossy or lagged connections. This includes smoothing opponent
positions, adding backwards reconciliation (unlagged), and projectile lerping,
among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Faithful, Modern OpenGL Renderer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrBoom+&amp;rsquo;s OpenGL renderer is outdated, using deprecated APIs and the
fixed-function pipeline. I will upgrade it to use the programmable pipeline,
and restore functionality lost to deprecation (paletted textures, for example).
I will also endeavour to ensure that anything possible with the original
software renderer will be possible with the new OpenGL renderer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Employ a Modern Scripting Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doom&amp;rsquo;s extensive modifiability created an entire generation of game designers,
but it has failed to keep up. ACS, DECORATE, EDF and ExtraData all attempt to
improve Doom&amp;rsquo;s extensibility, but all leave much to be desired. ACS is
particularly horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K will employ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lua.org&#34;&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;, a language &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games&#34;&gt;already widely used for
scripting&lt;/a&gt;, for
its assets and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Add Existing Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doom source ports have advanced tremendously over the years, but PrBoom+ has
remained relatively conservative. D2K will add many advanced features, from
those ports, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACS scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DECORATE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ExtraData&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAPINFO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D floors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D MidTex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slopes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polyobjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambient sounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for other ID Tech 1 engines (Heretic, Hexen, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UDMF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP/PK3 resource files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and much more. The goal, ultimately, is to be mod-compatible with even
highly advanced engines like the Eternity Engine and Zandronum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Maintain Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doom has a rich demo history, and it is important to preserve it. D2K will
continue PrBoom+&amp;rsquo;s commitment to demo compatibility by following Odamex&amp;rsquo; lead
and building a demo testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Internationalize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days of ASCII dominance are over. D2K will use UTF-8 internally and support
environments using non-ASCII encodings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Use Modern Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K will use C99, and will be progressively reformatted to use C99 features.
Compilers and IDEs with inadequate C99 support (such as MSVC++) are
unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;Promote Openness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Carmack released the Doom source code for Christmas in &amp;lsquo;97, and the Doom,
gaming, and developer communities owe him a huge debt of gratitude. None of
these modifications or advances would be possible without this initial gesture
of openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is much harder to work with PrBoom+&amp;rsquo;s source code than it is
to work with the original Doom source release. PrBoom+&amp;rsquo;s source is notoriously
impenetrable, full of hacks, and largely written in an unreadable style. This
has dramatically slowed the pace of contributions, and discourages would-be
developers from working on PrBoom+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ports have ported their code to C++, and while some of these efforts are
examples of how C++ doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be disgusting and confusing, others prove
that it is far too easy to create impossibly complex code with the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive Doom players are all too familiar with conservative developers
refusing to add features they or others personally disagree with. Such
recalcitrance has had a hugely negative impact on the entire Doom community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2K will continue the spirit of openness, not only through fulfilling its
obligations under the GPL, but by maintaining an accessible codebase. I will
diligently reformat code in a consistent, readable style, and I will attempt to
redesign hacked features in a more robust manner. Further, D2K will remain in C
to attempt to avoid C++&amp;rsquo;s complexity and lengthy compilation times. Finally,
D2K will always weigh new feature ideas on the merits, not on politics or
personal preference. A &amp;ldquo;vanilla&amp;rdquo; game will always be possible, and advanced
features will always be optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; id=&#34;zdoom&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;What do you have against (G)ZDoom?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became a competitive player on ZDaemon 1.08 (which was derived from ZDoom
1.23b33), and it is insanely fun to play; it might be the most fun I&amp;rsquo;ve ever
had playing a game. My argument against ZDoom and ZDoom-derived ports is not
that they aren&amp;rsquo;t fun or that they&amp;rsquo;re bad; I think they&amp;rsquo;re tons of fun and
pretty amazing. I am dismayed that ZDoom and its derivatives are what people
think of as &amp;ldquo;Doom&amp;rdquo;, when they are really entirely different engines that just
happen to load Doom resource files. What follows is heavy-handed, sharp
criticism of ZDoom, and while it may seem like I have a grudge against its
developers, in truth I respect and even like them. That said, here we go :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZDoom is in no way compatible with Doom demos. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been for years.
Furthermore, ZDoom breaks compatibility with its own demos haphazardly. One of
Doom&amp;rsquo;s strengths is its rich history, and ZDoom has no regard for preserving
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s physics and renderer are also drastically different than Doom&amp;rsquo;s, and it
isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to configure them to revert to original settings, because
vanilla behavior is not a priority for ZDoom developers. Even the super-shotgun
spread was changed. Such changes have huge effects on competitive play, but
this is also not a priority for ZDoom developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s licensing is restricted to non-commercial use only, which limits the
venues where Doom could expand. It also allows closing of the source code,
which has nearly destroyed the Doom community. There are several parts of the
codebase which, over the years, have illegaly incorporated code licensed under
incompatible licenses (Quake, for example). ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s popularity is largely due
to these incorporations, either illegal or under restrictive licenses, and has
therefore come at the expense of the Doom community as a whole. Modders were
left with a choice between proprietary, restricted ZDoom or an open port with
fewer features, and as a result, the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of Doom mods rely on
proprietary ZDoom features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZDoom continues to use features and code from non-free libraries and codebases,
most infamously FMOD and BUILD. However, to their credit, ZDoom developers
freely release their original code under the 2-clause BSD license, which, even
though it allows the source to be closed, at least offers other source port
developers the chance to incorporate those features in open ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s scripting language, ACS, is a nightmare. It is a terrible, weak
scripting language requiring a custom VM. Instead of responsibly using a
proper, 3rd party scripting language, ZDoom chose to extend ACS (first included
by Hexen). Because of ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s popularity, the de facto Doom scripting language
is ACS and the default level of ACS support is whatever ZDoom supports. Coupled
with the fact that until 2008, ACS could not be included in GPL source ports
due to its restrictive licensing, ZDoom essentially monopolized Doom scripting
with a proprietary, substandard language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ZDoom&amp;rsquo;s code style is inconsistent, at times unreadable, and often
downright dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;What do you have against C++?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++&amp;rsquo;s templates and better type-safety are clear improvements over C. However,
C++ incorporates four major misfeatures that, even though they are technically
optional, you must interact with any 3rd party code. Altogether, these
misfeatures outweigh C++&amp;rsquo;s advantages over C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Object-Oriented Programming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOP is centered around three major ideas: polymorphism, encapsulation, and
inheritance. Polymorphism is just a different placement of the business logic
dispatch, encapsulation is just a different (worse) placement of the object
state, and inheritance is unnecessary and harmful. Even worse, OOP is slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers often conflate powerful type systems with OOP, but there are type
systems even more powerful than that of C++ and Java in languages that do not
support OOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions disrupt the entire control flow of your program and are difficult to
reason about. This can be mitigated with checked exceptions, Java is an example
of this, but the try/catch syntax is burdensome, and developers consequently
let them become crashes rather than deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Operator Overloading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operator overloading produces code that is impossible to understand, as one
cannot know what the code actually does. The only case for operator overloading
is implementing additional numeric types, and support for this should be added
at a lower level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;The Standard Template Library&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While usually well-implemented and very useful, the STL is wildly over-verbose
and renders any application that uses it too complex to really use. In
fairness, this is because C++&amp;rsquo;s facilities for implementing generics are
over-verbose, but this is a criticism of C++, so the point is valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;What do you have against Microsoft Visual C++?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSVC++&amp;rsquo;s support for C is substandard, and their response to this charge is
&amp;ldquo;use C++&amp;rdquo;. That answer doesn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy me, for the aforementioned reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Why did you fork PrBoom+? Don&amp;rsquo;t you like Entryway?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose PrBoom+ for its OpenGL renderer, uncapped framerate, near-perfect
compatibility with several historical source ports, GPL license, and its C
codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entryway is obviously way smarter than me, which is why I chose to build upon
his work (not to mention the dozens of other contributors to PrBoom) work. It
would have taken me years to solve the problems he&amp;rsquo;s solved, presuming I&amp;rsquo;m
even skilled enough to do so.  I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this fork as an insult, I mean it
as a compliment :).&lt;/p&gt;
